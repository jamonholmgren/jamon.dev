  <p>So, last year we installed an above-ground 18' pool.</p>
  <p>
    I had my brother-in-law flatten out an area 25' in diameter, though, because
    I figured if this experiment went well we might want to upgrade to a 24'
    sometime later when the pool needed to be replaced.

  <p>It was a saltwater pool and also had a sand filter.</p>
  <p>
    I struggled to keep the water from getting murky, because I was a pool
    newbie who doesn't read directions very well.
  </p>
  <p>(In the second photo, you can see the water is too green.)</p>

  <p>
    I finally figured that out partway through summer and we enjoyed the pool
    the rest of the time.
  </p>
  <p>
    But then another rookie mistake: I entirely emptied my pool before winter,
    thinking that was the best thing to do.
  </p>
  <p>There was a windstorm in December and the pool collapsed.</p>
  <a
    href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1479215/210161638-bb38c390-cbdb-406f-afb1-9845f2dc9037.jpg"

  <p>So, off to the dump it went. Sad trombone.</p>
  <a
    href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1479215/210161617-a8c1e5dc-a683-4188-a9f6-2bb4856cfe41.jpg"

  <p>So we debated building an in-ground pool, but two major objections:</p>
  <p>1.Cost — figure minimum $80-100k, probably more.</p>
  <p>
    2.Ground water — we are perilously close to the water table, and it didn't
    seem like a good idea to tempt fate by digging a huge hole.
  </p>
  <p>
    But then Chyra started researching above ground pool decks. And it started
    making sense to go that route.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her brother builds decks but is always super busy. But! He was waiting for a
    big project to start. We got lucky.
  </p>
  <p>
    Doing a full deck around the whole thing would be cool, but also pretty
    expensive ($30-40k by itself). Instead, we decided to build it halfway
    around the pool. This saved nearly half of that.
  </p>
  <p>
    So my other bro-in-law came back (it pays to have brothers-in-law in
    construction) and dug it out.
  </p>
  <p>
    We went down 18" into the soil to sink the pool down and keep the deck
    height from being too high off the ground, which would look strange.
  </p>

  <p>Here's the end result.</p>

  /></a>
  <p>
    So the new pool is a Saltwater 8000 from
    <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePoolFactory" target="_blank"
      >@ThePoolFactory</a
    >. The truck came in, I backed my trailer up to it, and the driver dropped
    it right on the trailer.
  </p>
  <p>It's <strong>heavy</strong>.</p>
  <a
    href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1479215/210161667-90165b35-6366-420d-b8bb-9b4c0b8d5fcc.jpg"

  /></a>
  <p>
    So I towed it out into the field, had my "sand guy" deliver 10 cubic yards
    of sand, and my deck-building bro-in-law started working on the deck
    foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
    (You can see a laser transit in the foreground. Super handy for measuring
    levelness.)

    He started with the posts and joists, which are made from pressure treated
    lumber.
  </p>
  <p>
    The outside posts are 6'-0" on center (183 cm in non-freedom-units). The
    inside is carefully measured off the centerpoint to follow outside the outer
    wall of the pool.
  </p>
  <p>He built it very rugged. This thing could support an elephant.</p>
  <p>
    (Some of the supports in these photos are temporary and will be cut and
    attached more permanently.)

  <p>
    One reason the joists are so close together is we went with this
    <a href="https://twitter.com/timbertechABP">@timbertechABP</a>
    Trex-like composite decking. It can't span quite as far, but it is super
    durable.
  </p>

  <p>
    We designed the deck to end at a right angle to the pool but it didn't feel
    right, so we extended it with these wings. (Chyra did a great job with
    design all the way through.)
  </p>
  <p>The decking went on steadily over the course of several days.</p>

    By the way, you can see the vineyard behind our house in the distance. It's
    a little overgrown, although I did see the neighbor working on it today,
    which is nice to see.

    With the decking done, Walt (BIL) cut the inner curve of the pool edge off
    the decking, and it started looking like a deck!

    I didn't get many in-progress photos of the stairway, but rest assured like
    the rest of the deck that it's well-built.

    This is a good time to note that the biggest clump of clover is right at the
    foot of the stairway. I think we'll need to do something about it. I hate to
    lose the flowers for the bees but can't have my barefoot kids getting stung.

    With the deck mostly done (railing and gate still to be done, as well as the
    skirting and some other odds and ends), it was time to level out the sand
    and get it up to grade. A screed board around a central point works well for
    this.

    Walt then added pavers where each pool post will go and leveled them.
    Everything he does is within fractions of an inch — a real craftsman. He
    also tamped down the sand to compact it.

    The final panel was a stainless steel one that is bolted (with many bolts)
    onto both ends of the wall.

  <p>We screwed up a few times and had to redo it.</p>

    So I kept the pump and filter from the old pool. I was nervous that it
    wouldn't fit to the new pool's skimmer and outlet jet but it did. I was
    pretty happy about that.

    One intake needed to be capped off, so I had my dad 3D print me a new one.
    He's still pretty new to it so it took quite a few tries. In the end he
    bought a 1-1/4" PVC end cap and it fit perfectly, so I didn't get to use his
    3D printed one. Oh well.

    Unfortunately, we had to stop because the instructions say that we need 3"
    of sand in the bottom *inside* the pool wall (doesn't make sense to me). So
    I'm waiting for a load of sand Monday from my sand guy.
  </p>
  <p>I'll also call The Pool Factory and see if it's strictly necessary.</p>

    Sand guy was here this morning. I had him dump it in a more hidden area
    behind a bunch of young sequoias. Walt will bring a tractor here and use it
    to dump more sand in the pool bottom.

    Walt had called
    <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePoolFactory">@ThePoolFactory</a>
    but they said you absolutely need the 3" of sand in the bottom. Bummer; this
    isn't really a 54" pool then, if you lose 3" of the bottom.

    14,000 gallons will take 24-48 hours with a hose. It'll cost about $34 worth
    of city water.

    So
    <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePoolFactory">@ThePoolFactory</a>
    said that we *had* to put the 3" of additional sand in the bottom, but based
    on how much liner overlap we have on the walls, we definitely could have
    done without that. (We already had 3" as a base.) We could have gotten 2-3"
    of additional depth. 😒

  <p>We're estimating it'll be done filling by late afternoon tomorrow.</p>
  <p>I need to set up the pump and filter soon.</p>

    The project generates lots of cardboard boxes. I'm happy to have a lawnmower
    with a trailer so I can haul it to the street.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have a riding mower, I recommend getting one of these trailers. I use
    it all the time, for hauling dirt, bark dust, rock, packages, etc.

    Picking up salt ($14 for a 40 lb bag — need 9 of them) plus a bag of filter
    sand. The trailer hitch rack works well for this, although I put some of
    them inside the Wrangler.

    Pump set up. Waiting for water to get up to the intake so we can test it. I
    did turn it on with hose input and it worked, so that's cool. I had to do
    some modifications to get the pump to attach properly (it isn't for this
    pool) but no leaks that I can see!

    Trying not to fall in as I dump 40lb bags of salt in. Even with
    quick-dissolving pool salt it still settles on the bottom. I'll have to use
    the brush/squeegee to mix it up.

    Just shut off the water. Just under 48 hours of filling to hit the level we
    want.
  </p>
  <p>
    Salt level is 2045 PPM. We need to hit 3000-3200. The ocean is something
    like 30,000 PPM, so you won't really taste any salt in this water.

    Running the "Boost" mode to blast the pool with chlorine since we just swam
    in it. Salt level looks perfect, although I may dump one more bag in at some
    point (3000-3200 PPM is optimal).
  </p>
  <p>
    This says 73.4 degrees F, which is still chilly. The other thermometer shows
    72.
