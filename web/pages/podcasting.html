  <img width="600" alt="Jamon's podcasting setup" src="/static/podcast2.jpg" />
  <p>
    This is the podcasting setup I use and recommend. It's also what we use at
    <a href="https://infinite.red" target="_blank">Infinite Red</a> for our podcasting and video call meetings in
    general.
  </p>

  <h3>Equipment List</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Mixer: </strong>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UY0TQDA?tag=jamonholmgren-20" target="_blank"
        >Yamaha AG03 3-Channel Mixer / 1 Microphone</a
      >
      ($150)
      <p>
        This mixer is great and has a lot of features. But I also just set it up once and haven't touched it in ages.
        Only time it is a problem is if a kid comes by and plays with the settings.
      </p>
      <p>My current settings for the AG 03 mixer are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Slider: right on the thick line</li>
        <li>Gain knob: 85%</li>
        <li>Gain button: low (pressed in)</li>
        <li>Computer audio knob: 88%</li>
        <li>Guitar audio knob: 0% (unused)</li>
        <li>+48v and PAD buttons: off</li>
        <li>Monitor Speakers knob: 0% (unused)</li>
        <li>Monitor Headphones knob: 28%</li>
        <li>Comp / EQ button: off*</li>
        <li>Effect button: off</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        *However, you will PROBABLY want your Comp / EQ button to be on. I turn it off because our editors have their
        own software compressors and EQ settings and don't like my hardware ones messing with it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Microphone: </strong>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KCN83V8?tag=jamonholmgren-20" target="_blank"
        >Electro-Voice RE320 Large Diaphragm Dynamic Vocal Microphone</a
      >
      ($200 used, $300 new)
      <p>
        We've had good luck with used mics, so I'd buy a used one off of eBay or a renewed one from Amazon. Dynamic mics
        tend to work better than condenser mics in normal office environments (condenser mics work well in sound
        booths).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Headphones: </strong>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IT0IHOY?tag=jamonholmgren-20" target="_blank"
        >Sennheiser Pro Audio HD280PRO Headphone</a
      >
      ($80-100)
      <p>
        These aren't high-end headphones known for their wonderful music listening experience, but at under $100 that
        makes sense. What they are really good at is low bleed-through (where you hear in your mic what you hear in your
        headphones, in other words you pick up what the other people are saying in your mic — these are good at
        preventing that).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Microphone Arm Stand: </strong>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CN2C93T?tag=jamonholmgren-20" target="_blank"
        >InnoGear Microphone Arm Stand</a
      >
      ($50-60)
      <p>
        This one is better than the Rode which is $100. Microphone arm stands are great in that you don't get the
        bumps/thumps as you hit your desk while talking, and they smoothly swing out of the way when not podcasting.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Shock Mount: </strong>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FMSH7F2?tag=jamonholmgren-20" target="_blank">Microphone Shock Mount</a>
      ($12-16)
      <p>Reduces arm vibration getting to the mic.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>XLR Cable: </strong>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004TVJL1U?tag=jamonholmgren-20" target="_blank"
        >Hosa HMIC-010 Pro Microphone Cable</a
      >
      ($19-30)
      <p>
        You'll need just one cable, to go from your mic to the mixer. You can get 5 feet or 10 feet, whatever you need.
        Or get both a 5 and 10 foot cable, so you have options.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Total Cost</h3>
  <p>
    All in, you can get this setup for about <strong>$400</strong> depending on whether you buy new or used equipment.
    This is a professional-quality setup that will last you years.
