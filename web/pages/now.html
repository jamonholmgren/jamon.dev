      I'm back playing ice hockey, as a goalie, both of our
      <a href="https://suomipoikas.com" target="_blank">Poikas</a> teams, one at rec level and one at C level (a bit
      higher). I love playing hockey -- started when I was 19, stopped for about 13 years, and restarted when I was 37.

      I've launched a new
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JamonsCodeQuests">YouTube channel called Jamon's Code Quests</a>
      where I explore code in short, engaging videos. Tune in for coding insights, tips, and tricks!
