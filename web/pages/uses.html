  Here's a list of the hardware I use on a day-to-day basis. Note some links are
  affiliate links because ... well, I'll use the minor amount of revenue to buy
  more hardware, I guess.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Main Computer: 2022 Mac Studio M1 Max</strong>
    <p>
      This is my main driver and what I'm editing this website on right now.
      It's been a great computer! Quiet and powerful.
    </p>

      Secondary Computer:
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eluktronics.com/mech-17-gp/">
        2022 Eluktronics MECH-17 Grand Performance
      </a>
    </strong>
    <p>
      I really like this small, scrappy, DIY-friendly computer maker out of New
      Jersey. They primarily focus on gaming laptops. This is the second gaming
      laptop I've bought from them, and it's awesome -- comes with liquid
      cooling, even!
    </p>

      Display:

      >
        LG UltraFine 5k Display
      </a>
    </strong>
    <p>
      I use my primary computer in clamshell mode, so this is my primary
      display. It's a 5k display, which is a lot of pixels. It's also expensive.
      I sort of wish I had one of those huge curved displays, but this is pretty
      amazing in its own right.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Keyboard:
      <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3chrRXV">
        Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard
      </a>
    </strong>
    <p>
      I used the Apple Magic Keyboard for a while, but my hands weren't
      particularly comfortable. I generally like the Sculpt and would likely buy
      it again.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Trackpad:
      <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Hsof3O">Apple Magic Trackpad</a>
    </strong>
    <p>
      I don't really use a mouse these days, except for gaming, and for work I
      use the Magic Trackpad. It does the job and is pretty solid overall.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Mouse:
      <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3qKHYFW">
        Anker 2.4G Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Optical Mouse
      </a>
    </strong>
    <p>
      I don't use a mouse very often, but when I do, it's this ergonomic
      vertical mouse. Pretty inexpensive and does the job.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Headphones:
      <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CnCX8B">
        Sennheiser Pro Audio HD280PRO Headphone
      </a>
    </strong>
    <p>
      I podcast and stream, so I need decently nice headphones. These are
      comfortable and don't bleed through sound to the microphone.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Microphone:
      <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3qL5xOP">
        Electro-Voice RE320 and Broadcast Arm
      </a>
    </strong>
    <p>
      This is a fantastic microphone for my podcasting and streaming. It sounds
      amazing and the arm makes it very convenient to push out of the way when
      I'm not using it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Mixing Console:
      <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cjE7qZ"
        >Yamaha AG03 Mixing Console</a
      >
    </strong>
    <p>
      This mixing console allows me to connect the microphone to my computer and
      also allows for adjusting volume, monitor (which I use) and other stuff I
      don't understand. It's a great piece of equipment, albeit takes up a bit
      of desk space.

      Desk:
      <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/328ZObz">
        Zinus Alicia Industrial Style [Desk]
      </a>
    </strong>
    <p>
      I have long legs and prefer a deep desk. This is technically a dining
      table, but I use it as a desk and it looks and works great. The only issue
      is that the table surface is slightly rough/uneven. However, with the
      desktop pad (below), I don't notice it.

    </strong>
    <p>
      This is one of my favorite desk accessories. It pads the underside of my
      keyboard and lets me slide everything under my

    </strong>
    <p>
      Call me basic, but I honestly like this chair. It fits my body pretty well
      and I can sit on it for hours.
