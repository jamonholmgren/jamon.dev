    I'm a software developer, business owner, rec league ice hockey goalie, husband, and father of four. I'm located in
    the beautiful Pacific Northwest USA.

    <a href="https://infinite.red" target="_blank">Infinite Red</a>, a fully remote React Native app development studio
    located in the USA and Canada. We're the best
    <a href="https://reactnative.dev" target="_blank">React Native</a> experts you'll find, and I'm very proud of the
    team we've built.

  <h2>I've loved making software<br />for a very long time.</h2>

  <p>
    When my dad brought home a 286 in 1991, I was enthralled. I watched as he painstakingly typed and simultaneously
    repeated
    <code>cd \games</code> and saw the screen scroll and change. It was mind-blowing to a ten year old.
  </p>
  <p>
    A couple years later, a middle school math teacher gave me a book on BASIC programming, and said she had noticed I
    liked computers. At home, I discovered that our new 486DX computer had QBasic. I was in heaven.
  </p>
  <p>
    That has led to a life-long obsession with coding. The journey has taken me from running large excavation equipment
    to framing houses to 3D CAD design, until I eventually landed on a career in software.
