<h2 class="opening">I've loved software for a very long time.</h2>

<p>
  When my dad brought home a 286 in 1991, I was enthralled. I watched as he
  painstakingly typed and simultaneously repeated
  <code>cd backslash games enter</code> and saw the screen scroll and change. It
  was mind-blowing to a ten year old.
</p>
<p>
  A couple years later, a middle school math teacher gave me a book on BASIC
  programming, and said she had noticed I liked computers. At home, I discovered
  that our new 486DX computer had QBasic. I was in heaven.
</p>
<p>
  That has led to a life-long obsession with coding. The journey has taken me
  from running large excavation equipment to framing houses to 3D CAD design,
  until I eventually landed on a career in software.
