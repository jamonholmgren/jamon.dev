  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>
    Jamon is a software developer, business owner, husband, and father of four, located near Portland, Oregon, in SW
    Washington state. He is one of the co-founders of Infinite Red, Inc., a fully remote React Native app development
    studio located across the USA and Canada. He learned to code at age twelve in order to make games (the game store
    was too far away from where he grew up) and that led to a lifelong obsession with coding. He is active in open
    source, plays ice hockey on a Finnish-American team, and takes any excuse to use his tractor that he can.

  <h2>Talks — Recent and Upcoming</h2>
  <p>
    I sometimes give talks at conferences (when I'm not
    <a href="http://chainreactconf.com" target="_blank">helping organize one</a>) and meetups. I've added links to a few
    here and will try to keep it up to date. In the upcoming section, I've also added some other meetups and conferences
    I plan to attend even if I'm not speaking, in case you want to connect there.
  </p>
  <h3>Upcoming</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I'll be around at various React Native conferences this year and next. Keep an eye on
      <a href="https://twitter.com/jamonholmgren" target="_blank">my Twitter</a>
