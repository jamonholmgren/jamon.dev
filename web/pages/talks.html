My talks - Jamon Holmgren

<h2>Talk headshot and bio</h2>
<p>
  It's convenient to have a place to send people for a bio and headshot for my
  various talks -- and this is it.

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>
  Jamon is a software developer, business owner, husband, and father of four,
  located near Portland, Oregon, in SW Washington state. He is one of the
  co-founders of Infinite Red, Inc., a fully remote React Native app development
  studio located across the USA and Canada. He learned to code at age twelve in
  order to make games (the game store was too far away from where he grew up)
  and that led to a lifelong obsession with coding. He is active in open source,
  plays ice hockey on a Finnish-American team, and takes any excuse to use his
  tractor that he can.
</p>
<h2>Talks — Recent and Upcoming</h2>
<p>
  I sometimes give talks at conferences (when I'm not
  <a href="https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf" target="_blank"
    >helping organize one</a
  >) and meetups. I've added links to a few here and will try to keep it up to
  date. In the upcoming section, I've also added some other meetups and
  conferences I plan to attend even if I'm not speaking, in case you want to
  connect there.
