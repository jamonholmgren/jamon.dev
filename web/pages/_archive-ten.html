<h2>Ten Years</h2>
<p><em>Published August 1, 2015</em></p>
<p>
  I sat down at my desk in my spare bedroom and logged into my Windows XP
  home-built computer. Two seventy pound Sony Trinitron 21” CRT monitors stared
  back at me on my $10 folding table, and I pulled up my new Gmail account to
  see what my first project would be. On the floor, my new 7 month old boy was
  laying on a blanket and smiling up at me.
</p>
<p>
  It was exactly ten years ago -- August 1, 2005, my first official day working
  for myself -- and my uncle Ed was my first customer.

  The Architectural Designer: 2005 - 2006
</h3>
<p>
  My first project was a new home design, with 3D renderings. I had been
  practicing with Chief Architect 10 for a couple months, so I knew the basics.
  And of course my previous job had involved CAD work for New Tradition Homes, a
  regional home builder in the area.
</p>
<p>
  My invoice (to Ed) for the whole month of August, 2005, was for $1,113.70.
  After getting a nice paycheck for three years from New Tradition, this was a
  big wakeup call. It was up to me to make things happen now.
</p>
<p>
  But 3D home design was a lot of fun. In 2005, home building was a mad dash,
  and everyone was throwing money around for anything house-related. As some of
  the first home designers to do 3D renderings in our area, Ed and I were
  inundated with work. We kept raising our prices and kept getting projects.
  Ludicrous 8,000 square foot concepts crossed our desks, and everybody had wild
  dreams and lots of credit.
</p>
<p>
  I even got a chance to design a huge Lake Oswego remodel for then-GM of the
  Portland Trail Blazers, Kevin Pritchard. I was an avid Blazer fan, so Chyra
  and I got skybox tickets every couple weeks.
</p>

<p>
  Home design paid the bills (after the first few shaky months) and I enjoyed
  it, but I’d always been fascinated by programming. I’d spent way too much time
  building games in QBasic on my parents’ computers in middle school and high
  school, and the idea of getting paid to code sounded pretty good to me.
</p>
<p>
  Armed with a copy of Dreamweaver MX 2004, a book on PHP 5 and MySQL, and
  another one on JavaScript, I started marketing my web design services to local
  business owners that I knew. With a low rate of $45/hour, it was still
  surprisingly hard to convince people they should use me. But I slowly built my
  clientele list, one $1500 website after another.
</p>
<p>
  My first websites were so, so awful. It wasn’t really the code; they were
  simple websites, and I’d always been a clean coder. But I also did the design
  (using Paint Shop Pro 9). Luckily, expectations were low.
</p>

<p>
  I was feeling pretty good. My income wasn’t great, but I was paying the bills.
  And if I could just string together a few good months in a row, I’d be doing a
  lot more than that.
</p>
<p>
  Then, in April of 2007, the home design work just cut off. Ed barely had
  enough design work for himself, much less any to send to me. I sat staring at
  an empty inbox for a couple days, then made the decision. Time to go out and
  sell.
</p>
<p>
  I learned a lot about sales doing cold calling. It sucked, for one thing. I
  was able to keep things running, though, through sheer force of will, and by
  the beginning of 2009 I decided that things were going well enough to get an
  office and maybe an employee or two.
</p>
<h3 id="theworkaholic20092011">The Workaholic: 2009 - 2011</h3>
<p>
  I rented a spare office from New Tradition in their nice new building, and
  hired a few inexperienced employees. I also built a PHP framework called
  phpGenesis that allowed us to build websites very quickly. My clientele grew
  by word of mouth and SEO efforts and I started taking on more complex
  projects, including a sales CRM and a manufacturing system for a local cabinet
  shop. I also built my own invoicing, time tracking, and project management
  system, and landed a few larger sales. We were up to about 7 employees.
</p>
<p>
  We were making good money, finally. But I was putting in way too much time in
  the office. My wife had two small children at home and I was working 9 AM to
  nearly midnight every day.
</p>
<p>It was a rough time for both of us. And by mid-2011, I was tired of it.</p>
<h3 id="therailsdeveloper2011">The Rails Developer: 2011</h3>
<p>
  I started hiring more people and delegating more, and getting to go home a bit
  earlier. One of my hires was Daniel Berkompas, a young but talented developer
  who was also going to law school. Daniel kept telling me that we should be
  using Macs and doing Ruby on Rails. I had dabbled with Rails, but my PHP
  framework was just so easy to learn and fast to build websites in.
</p>
<p>
  But we weren’t just building websites. We had web applications to code, and
  the framework just wasn’t designed to handle those. After a few bad
  experiences building large code bases in phpGenesis, I decided to try our next
  website in Rails. Daniel led the project and it was a resounding success.
</p>
<p>
  I resolved to use Ruby on Rails as often as we could from then on. I even
  bought a MacBook Pro, and loved it. Some of my longer-term employees weren’t
  happy with this decision, but over time Rails (and Macs) won them over too.
</p>
<h3 id="theiosdeveloper20122013">The iOS Developer: 2012 - 2013</h3>
<p>
  In 2011-2012, iPads were all the rage. I bought one for “research” and started
  playing around with Xcode and Objective-C. We built a few PhoneGap apps and
  found that it was hard to get them to live up to their promise.
</p>
<p>
  Then, in mid-2012, someone emailed about building an iPhone and iPad app,
  coupled with a web application.
</p>
<p>
  This was our chance. There was a new product that had just come out, called
  RubyMotion, and I liked the idea of building the iPhone, iPad, and Rails apps
  all in Ruby. So I submitted a quote and secured the sale.
</p>
<p>
  Silas Matson (one of my young developers) and I started working on it. I knew
  enough about iOS development by that point to get basic things to work, but it
  was slow going. So I started working on a new RubyMotion code library to speed
  things up, called ProMotion.
</p>
<p>
  Turns out, lots of people needed to speed up their iPhone development
  workflow. ProMotion started getting quite popular, and I even got invited to
  speak at a few conferences and meetups.
</p>
<p>
  During all this time, I was right in the thick of things, coding every day and
  helping my employees get through problems. It was fun but exhausting.
</p>
<h3 id="theowner2014">The Owner: 2014</h3>
<p>
  I was ready to stop coding and start running my business. As it happened, a
  designer I respected greatly was interested in coming to work for me. Mike
  Waszazak joined the team as my Creative Director and a new era was born.
</p>
<p>
  Mike had run his own business before. He was the right balance of
  knowledgeable, authoritative, and yet respectful of me and my business that I
  had worked so hard on. He raised the bar for everyone, including me, and
  helped me develop all parts of the business, not just the design department.
</p>
<p>
  Then, in January 2015 Mike left to go back to his previous position as
  Communications Director at New Heights Church in the area. It was a big loss,
  but with Mike’s help we were headed in the right direction and the team felt
  cohesive and solid.

<p>
  And so here we are. My little boy is now 10 years old and has three younger
  sisters to look after. I’ve managed to reduce my workdays to a more reasonable
  9 hours per day. And there are some very exciting things in the works that I’m
  looking forward to announcing soon.
</p>
<p>(Note: <a href="/archive/next">here is that announcement!</a>)</p>
<p>
  It’s been an awesome ten years. I’ve learned so much. I’ve had exhilarating
  days where I would call my wife in the middle of the day just bouncing with
  excitement, and had horrible days where I couldn’t meet anyone’s expectations.
  I’ve had opportunities pass me by, and had others hit me right on. I’ve had
  great mentors and colleagues and awesome employees.

  Despite my blog post headings looking like it’s all about me, I’d never have
  done it without my great employees and contractors and others. It’s a bit
  corny and sappy, I’ll admit, but this is my favorite part of this blog post.
