  Here's a list of everything I've bought for my gym, total $2,977 plus tax. I
  actually got some of the dumbbells at garage sales and probably spent about
  $2700 total including tax. Figuring $50/month each for my wife and me to have
  gym memberships, this will pay for itself in a little over 2 years.

<p>
  In November of 2016 I started working out with Ryan Linton. I was 30 lbs
  overweight and starting to feel my age. I knew if I didn't do something soon,
  I was going to have a body that would hurt for a long time.
</p>
<p>
  In mid-2018, once my home was restored<span>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/jamonholmgren/status/945465737874829317"
      >from the arson that happened 5 months prior,</a
    > </span
  >I started thinking about building an in-home gym. After all, I have a
  three-car garage and plenty of room, and while I was doing well getting to the
  gym two to three times per week, I knew I would do better if the gym was in my
  house.
</p>
<p>
  I started by doing a bunch of research and ordered the parts. Here's what I
  have so far and what I am planning to do next.

    >Rogue RML-3W Fold Back Wall Mount Rack</a
  >
</h3>
<p>When it comes to lifting, don't scrimp on the bar or the rack.</p>
<p>
  The RML-3W wall rack has been awesome. I do recommend getting the metal
  stringers to mount to the wall. It took me and my 13 year old son an hour or
  so to install and is rock-solid. It's mounted to a wall with 2x6 studs and the
  lag bolts hold it very securely. The garage floor slopes a bit left-to-right
  which means I did slide a little 1.25lb weight under one side to level out the
  rack, but I don't notice the 1/2" difference side-to-side. There's also a
  super simple adjustment in the way it's engineered that lets it sit on the
  floor no matter what.
</p>

  alt="Rogue RML-3W Fold Back Wall Mount Rack"

<p>
  When folded against the wall, it takes up very little room. I don't however
  fold it up very often — there really isn't any point, since there's plenty of
  room to do everything we need to do, and we don't park in that garage bay. It
  takes about 2 minutes to fold up or unfold. The J-hooks are solid and it feels
  pro. I'm 6'-4" and the pull-up bar is high enough (especially considering I
  don't have much more ceiling height to work with).

  The Alpha set includes the
  <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-ohio-power-bar"
    >Rogue Ohio Bar (20kg/44lbs)</a
  >
  in Black Zinc/Bright Zinc. I absolutely love this bar. It's somewhat flexible
  so it feels "alive" and yet has the strength to easily load on 400 lbs, which
  is the most I've put on it. It's also 28.5mm in diameter (1 1/8”) which is
  somewhat smaller and feels very good in the hand. It works great for deadlift,
  squats (front and back), bench, overhead press, and everything else I've tried
  it with.

/>
<p>
  The bumper set is great because it includes four 45 lb bumper plates, two 35s,
  two 25s, and two 10s. Bumper plates are fantastic, if you haven't tried them
  yet. I will only buy bumper plates for the majority of my bar weight. It also
  comes with V3 Monster Lite J-Cups (j-hooks) and a pair of Rogue Spring
  Collars.

  This set of interlocking rubber mats was perfectly sized for my gym. It was so
  easy to put together that my kids did it. They feel good on my feet and
  withstand the bumper plates being dropped without a problem.

  I haven't gotten around to mounting these yet (I'm waiting until I get time to
  also get the mirrors listed at the end of this), but they seem sturdy enough.
  They're from Titan, which is a lower-cost alternative to Rogue. For wall
  storage, I figure the cheaper option is fine (I wouldn't buy a Titan wall rack
  though).

<p>
  These CAP hex dumbbells are convenient and rugged. I bought 12, 15, 20, 25,
  and 40 lb pairs, mostly from garage sales, but you can see them on Amazon at
  the link. I would recommend getting 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50
  lbs if you have the budget. They're my go-to dumbbells. For the in-between
  weights, I use the adjustable weights (next 2 items).

<p>
  These dumbbells aren't my favorite. I actually have two sets, since I bought
  one set from my brother. They sit mostly unused on the weight rack now that I
  have the other dumbbells (see below). I would only recommend buying them if
  you're on a tight budget but need a really wide and flexible range of weight.
  They're a pain to adjust and frequently come loose. They also tend to clink
  together when doing overhead press, because the bars are super long. But I
  have also put a lot of heavy reps up with them, so they will do the job.

<p>
  These awkward-looking things are actually very pleasant to use. Unlike the
  other adjustable dumbbells, they're very quick to change to a different
  weight. You can adjust in 2.5 lb adjustments and go from 5 lbs to 50 lbs. (It
  for some reason doesn't include a setting for 12.5 lbs, though.) They're not
  hard on your hands and feel comfortable.

  This rowing machine is okay, but I don't use it all that often. It feels a bit

  I do hockey for cardio now.
