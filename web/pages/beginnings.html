<h1>Beginnings</h1>
<p>
  I grew up just outside a small town in northwest Oregon, called Clatskanie. My
  dad was a millwright and eventually started his own small excavation business,
  and my mom took care of me and my eight siblings. Yes, you read that right — I
  have eight awesome siblings! Three sisters and five brothers. And no, we're
  not Mormon nor Catholic — we're Lutherans, actually.

  My childhood was really idyllic in a lot of ways. My parents bought a
  foreclosed home on a VA loan (my dad served in the US Army just after
  Vietnam). The house was situated on about eight acres and was bordered by vast
  swathes of uninhabited timberland. I spent my younger years exploring the
  woods with my dog and, later, some of my younger brothers.
