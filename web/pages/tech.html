  <h3>QB64</h3>
  <p>
    I rewrote my website (this one) in QB64, which is a somewhat modern version
    of QBasic. It was quite a bit of work, but I got it to work and am
    inordinately proud of that.

  <h3>React Native Live -- Twitch streaming</h3>
  <p>
    Every week, I've been streaming
    <a href="https://twitch.tv/jamonholmgren">on Twitch</a> and exploring a lot
    of React Native code.

  <h3>AI/ML</h3>
  <p>
    I'm pretty convinced artificial intelligence / machine learning will change
    the world. Keep an eye on my Twitter for lots of content about that.
