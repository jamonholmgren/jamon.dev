  <h3>Godot</h3>
  <p>
    I started making a game last year, and it's been incredibly fun! Check out my game development website (<a
      href="https://jammin.games/?s=jamon.dev"
      target="_blank"
      >jammin.games</a
    >) and see latest progress there or <a href="https://x.com/jammingames" target="_blank">on 𝕏</a>.

  <p>
    <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> itself is a very capable and fun game engine. I'm
    having a blast working on it.

  <h3>React Native for desktop</h3>
  <p>
    I've been hacking on a new <a href="https://reactotron.com/" target="_blank">Reactotron</a> in
    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos" target="_blank">React Native for macOS</a>, and that's
    been an interesting project at work!
  </p>
  <p>Desktop apps have always been interesting to me, and combining it with my React Native experience is fun.</p>
