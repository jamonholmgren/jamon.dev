    <a href="/blog/2025/#adhd3">ADHD Update: after (almost) a year</a>
  </h2>

  <i>May 27, 2025</i>

  <p>
    Almost a year ago I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, and I
    <a href="https://jamon.dev/blog/2024/#adhd">wrote about it</a>. I also followed up with another
    <a href="https://jamon.dev/blog/2024/#adhd2">article</a> a few months later.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a recap, I have long suspected I have ADHD, was finally convinced by my wife Chyra to get it checked, was
    diagnosed with "inattentive ADHD", and was prescribed Vyvanse (aka "lisdexamphetamine") and Intuniv (aka
    "guanfacine").
  </p>
  <p>
    After 6 months I was still dealing with sleep disruption, and after talking to my doctor, I reduced my Vyvanse dose
    from 40mg to 30mg. This really helped me get better sleep, although it's still not quite as good as it was before I
    was on stimulants.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's not a ton to report, because at this point it seems to just be working as it should, and I'm moving forward
    with life. That's a good thing!
  </p>
  <p>
    游릭 <strong>Intensity:</strong> It's at a good level -- not too intense, but noticable improvement in focus and lower
    distractability.
  </p>

  <p>
    游릭 <strong>Creativity:</strong> I'm still coming up with ideas and executing on them, but I'm currently focusing on
    ... focusing, and reducing the complexity in my life.
  </p>

  <p>
    游릭 <strong>Mood:</strong> My mood has been good, in general. Some of this has to do with better stability in other
    parts of my life, which is due to a lot of work, which in turn is helped by my increased ability to focus.
  </p>

  <p>
    游리 <strong>Weight loss:</strong> This continues to be a struggle for me, but I think the Vyvanse has indeed helped.
    But it's not a miracle drug. I still have to put in the work.
  </p>

  <p>
    游릭 <strong>Sleep:</strong> With good sleep habits and the lower dose, my sleep has improved immensely. It's about 7
    hours a night, which is sustainable at my age.
