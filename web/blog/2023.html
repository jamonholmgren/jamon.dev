    <a href="/blog/2023/#review">2023 was a great year</a>
  </h2>

  <i>Dec 22, 2023</i>

  <p>In December each year, I tend to get reflective. This year is no different.</p>

  <p>
    I had a tremendous amount of personal growth this year. I think I told a few people this, but there were many things
    that took me way too long to learn. This year, I felt like I turned the corner.
  </p>

  <p>I'm a slow learner, but I get there eventually.</p>

  <p>In terms of big events/accomplishments, here are a few:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Survived a bumpy Q1 and had a great year in the end</li>
    <li>My son graduated...and then got married to his sweetheart Patricia</li>
    <li>Gave a talk in Poland that was well-received</li>
    <li>Gave two excellent AI workshops in Atlanta for renderATL with Gant</li>
    <li>Secured several very high-profile projects for Infinite Red</li>
    <li>Launched my <a href="https://youtube.jamon.dev">YouTube channel</a></li>
    <li>30 <a href="https://reactnativeradio.com">React Native Radio</a> episodes</li>
    <li>Hired one of my best friends and still kept the relationship going</li>
    <li>Integrated Robin Heinze into engineering leadership at Infinite Red</li>
    <li>Helped launch Ignite 9, Reactotron 3, and the new IR Docs website</li>
    <li>Created Flame AI, which has languished a bit but was very interesting</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I'm proud of the work I did this year. There were definitely some really tough moments. But some highlights as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Going into 2024, I want to produce more video content on my YouTube channel and Twitch. I'd like to see what else we
    could do at Infinite Red. I'd like to do more interviews of interesting people, both for work as well as just random
    folks ... I have a few in mind who would be amazing.
  </p>

  <p>
    And, as always, I want to get in shape. I'm playing a lot of hockey and that's great. But I also need to lose about
    20 lbs to really feel good about myself. I'm not getting any younger.
  </p>

    Happy Thanksgiving, friends! I'm grateful for all of you. I'm a lucky guy -- I have an amazing family, great team,
    my role is super fun and challenging, and I even still get to code from time to time.
  </p>

  <p>I hope you have a wonderful weekend!</p>

    Excellent support experience with
    <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/">Josh Comeau</a> on a thing I wanted to do with my account today. Fast
    responses, great result. 5 stars.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those who don't know, he puts out _extremely_ high quality courses on React and CSS and other web-related
    technologies. He's super impressive and honestly I wish I had his level of talent and drive and patience. Go buy his
    courses!

    <a href="/blog/2023/#start">Starting a new lightweight blog</a>
  </h2>

  <i>Nov 22, 2023</i>

  <p>
    I've been thinking about starting a new blog for a while. I've had a few different blogs over the years, but they've
    all been pretty heavy. I've used Wordpress, Ghost, and even a custom-built blog engine. I've also used Medium.com,
    but I don't like the way they've been going lately. I want something that's simple, fast, and easy to use.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this, I decided to use basic HTML, and just have every blog post be an entry in a single HTML file per year.
  </p>
  <p>Let's see how it works long-term.</p>
