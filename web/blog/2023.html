  Excellent support experience with
  <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/">Josh Comeau</a> on a thing I wanted to
  do with my account today. Fast responses, great result. 5 stars.

  For those who don't know, he puts out _extremely_ high quality courses on
  React and CSS and other web-related technologies. He's super impressive and
  honestly I wish I had his level of talent and drive and patience. Go buy his
  courses!

  <a href="/blog/2023/#start">Starting a new lightweight blog</a>
</h2>

<i>Nov 22, 2023</i>

<p>
  I've been thinking about starting a new blog for a while. I've had a few
  different blogs over the years, but they've all been pretty heavy. I've used
  Wordpress, Ghost, and even a custom-built blog engine. I've also used
  Medium.com, but I don't like the way they've been going lately. I want
  something that's simple, fast, and easy to use.
</p>
<p>
  For this, I decided to use basic HTML, and just have every blog post be an
  entry in a single HTML file per year.
</p>
<p>Let's see how it works long-term.</p>
