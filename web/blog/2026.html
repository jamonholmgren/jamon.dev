  <p>
    Happy New Year! I'm excited for what 2026 has in store for me. I'm still working on my
    game, <a href="https://jammin.games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Into the Dawn</a>, and hoping to get an early release out in the latter part of the year.

  <p>I hope your new year is off to a great start!</p>
